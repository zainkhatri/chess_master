  - **Lichess.org Open Database:**
    https://database.lichess.org/#variant_games
    
    We plan to use the lichess.org open database. Database exports are released under the Creative Commons CC0 license, which allows usage for research, commercial purposes, publication, or any other purpose without permission.
    - **Standard Chess, Variants, Puzzles, Evaluations:**
      - Over 6.3 billion standard rated games played on lichess.org in PGN format. Each file contains the games for one month only (e.g., January 2025: 32.9 GB with 100,412,379 games; December 2024: 31.6 GB with 96,587,411 games).
      - More than 100 million chess games overall.
      - 190,987,505 chess positions evaluated with Stockfish, produced by the lichess analysis board running various flavors of Stockfish in user browsers.
